Results from the ordinary least-squares fit by QR-decomposition: 

Fit parameters: a = 4.95112516950657, Î» = -0.172070796448846
From the fit, the half-life of Ra-224 is estimated to: 4.02826740426001 days
The table value is 3.63 days, so the value from the fit is a bit of an over-
estimation. Source: wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_radium
