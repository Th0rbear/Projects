The directory "exercises" cotains the solutions to the mandatory exercises throughout the course, and the content 
consists mostly of the practical part of the course. The directory "homeworks" includes all the homeworks in
the course, which have some weighting for the final grade given in the course. The solutions to the exercises
and homeworks are in subdirectories, to these two corresponding parent directories. All programs can be initialized
by using the command "make", or first using "make clean" and then "make".

The examination project can be found in the "exam" folder.
